#CodeWednesdayChallenge
The Code Challenge is where you get to work on certain projects or tasks to complete them within given time/duration.


Rules:
Each Individual taking part Should have a Github account and name your folder according to the challenge you are working on. (e.g challenge1-password-generator)
Eligibility: The challenge is open to participants of all skill levels who are familiar with Python programming.
Submission: Participants should submit their solution as a Python script or Jupyter Notebook file.
Deadline: The challenge will have a specific deadline for submission. 8PM(SA & EAT).
Original Work: Participants must create their solutions from scratch specifically for this challenge.
Code Quality: Solutions should follow Python best practices, including proper indentation, variable naming conventions, and appropriate use of comments to explain the code's functionality.
Functionality: Solutions should adhere to the provided problem statement and produce the expected outputs.
Testing: Participants are encouraged to test their solutions with different input scenarios to ensure their code is working correctly.
Documentation: Participants should include a brief explanation of their approach or algorithm, as well as any additional notes or assumptions made during the solution development.(One Page) or README.md
Code Readability: Solutions should be clear, concise, and well-structured, allowing other developers to understand and follow the code easily.
Respect and Sportsmanship: Participants should demonstrate respect and good sportsmanship throughout the challenge, promoting a friendly and inclusive coding environment.
Judging: Solutions will be evaluated based on correctness, code quality, efficiency, and adherence to the challenge rules.
Results and Recognition: Participants with the most innovative, efficient, and well-implemented solutions will be acknowledged and may receive recognition based on their performance.(Special Prizes)

Starting off with Python:
Create a program that generates a random password. The password should be at least 8 characters long and contain a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
Create a program that reads in a text file and counts the number of occurrences of each word in the file. The program should then print out a list of the top 10 most frequent words, along with their counts.
Create a program that simulates a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors. The program should prompt the user to enter their choice, then randomly generate the computer's choice. The program should then determine the winner based on the standard rules of the game.
Create a program that reads in a CSV file containing data on a set of stocks. The program should then calculate the average daily return for each stock and print out a list of the top 10 performing stocks.
Create a program that generates a random maze and solves it using the depth-first search algorithm. The program should display the maze, show the path from the start to the finish, and calculate the time taken to solve the maze.
Create a program that generates a set of random coordinates on a 2D plane and calculates the shortest path that visits each point exactly once. The program should use a genetic algorithm to find an optimal solution.
Create a program that reads in a text file and creates a word cloud, where the size of each word is proportional to its frequency in the text. The program should then display the word cloud as an image.
Create a program that scrapes a website for data on a particular topic and creates a visualization of the data. For example, the program could scrape a news website for data on the most common topics in the news, then create a pie chart showing the distribution of topics.
Create a program that generates a set of random numbers and sorts them using the quicksort algorithm. The program should then calculate the time taken to sort the numbers.
Create a program that reads in a text file and creates a markov chain model of the text. The program should then use the model to generate a random sentence that is similar in style to the original text.
NB: Examples of the challenges will be uploaded after the challenge with different types of methods.
